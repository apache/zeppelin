# Contribution Guidelines

**Apache Zeppelin** is an [Apache2 License](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) Software.

Contributing to Zeppelin (Source code, Documents, Image, Website) means you agree to the Apache2 License.

1. Make sure your issue is not already in the [Jira issue tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN)
2. If not, create a ticket describing the change you're proposing in the [Jira issue tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN)
3. Contribute your patch via Pull Request on our [Github Mirror](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin).

Before you start, please read the [Code of Conduct](http://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html) carefully, familiarize yourself with it and refer to it whenever you need it.

For those of you who are not familiar with Apache project, understanding [How it works](http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html) would be quite helpful.

## Creating a Pull Request
When creating a Pull Request, you will automatically get the template below.

Filling it thoroughly can improve the speed of the review process.

    ### What is this PR for?
    A few sentences describing the overall goals of the pull request's commits.
    First time? Check out the contribution guidelines - https://zeppelin.apache.org/contribute.html

    ### What type of PR is it?
    [Bug Fix | Improvement | Feature | Documentation | Hot Fix | Refactoring]

    ### Todos
    * [ ] - Task

    ### What is the Jira issue?
    * Open an issue on Jira https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN/
    * Put link here, and add [ZEPPELIN-*Jira number*] in PR title, eg. [ZEPPELIN-533]

    ### How should this be tested?
    Outline the steps to test the PR here.

    ### Screenshots (if appropriate)

    ### Questions:
    * Does the licenses files need update?
    * Is there breaking changes for older versions?
    * Does this needs documentation?

## Testing a Pull Request
You can also test and review a particular Pull Request. Here are two useful ways.

* Using a utility provided from Zeppelin.

    ```
    dev/test_zeppelin_pr.py [# of PR]
    ```

    For example, if you want to test `#513`, then the command will be:

    ```
    dev/test_zeppelin_pr.py 513
    ```

* Another way is using [github/hub](https://github.com/github/hub).

    ```
    hub checkout https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/[# of PR]
    ```

The above two methods will help you test and review Pull Requests.

## Source Control Workflow
Zeppelin follows [Fork & Pull] (https://github.com/sevntu-checkstyle/sevntu.checkstyle/wiki/Development-workflow-with-Git:-Fork,-Branching,-Commits,-and-Pull-Request) model.

## The Review Process

When a Pull Request is submitted, it is being merged or rejected by the  following review process.

* Anybody can be a reviewer and may comment on the change or suggest modifications.
* Reviewer can indicate that a patch looks suitable for merging with a comment such as: "Looks good", "LGTM", "+1".
* At least one indication of suitability (e.g. "LGTM") from a committer is required to be merged.
* Pull request is open for 1 or 2 days for potential additional review, unless it's got enough indication of suitability.
* A committer can then initiate lazy consensus ("Merge if there is no more discussion") after what the code can be merged after a certain time (normally 24 hours) if there is no more reviews.
* Contributors can ping reviewers (including committers) by commenting 'Ready to review' or suitable indication.

## Becoming a Committer

The PMC adds new committers from the active contributors, based on their contribution to Zeppelin.

The qualifications for new committers include:

1. Sustained contributions: Committers should have a history of constant contributions to Zeppelin.
2. Quality of contributions: Committers more than any other community member should submit simple, well-tested, and well-designed patches.
3. Community involvement: Committers should have a constructive and friendly attitude in all community interactions. They should also be active on the dev, user list and reviewing patches. Also help new contributors and users.


## Setting up
Here are some things you will need to build and test Zeppelin.

### Software Configuration Management (SCM)

Zeppelin uses Git for its SCM system. so you'll need git client installed in your development machine.

### Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

You are free to use whatever IDE you prefer, or your favorite command line editor.

### Project Structure

Zeppelin project is based on Maven. Maven works by convention & defines [directory structure] (https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html) for a project.
The top-level pom.xml describes the basic project structure. Currently Zeppelin has the following modules.

    <module>zeppelin-interpreter</module>
    <module>zeppelin-zengine</module>
    <module>spark</module>
    <module>markdown</module>
    <module>angular</module>
    <module>shell</module>
    <module>flink</module>
    <module>ignite</module>
    <module>lens</module>
    <module>cassandra</module>
    <module>zeppelin-web</module>
    <module>zeppelin-server</module>
    <module>zeppelin-distribution</module>

### Code convention
We are following Google Code style:

* [Java style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)
* [Shell style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shell.xml)

Check style report location are in `${submodule}/target/site/checkstyle.html`
Test coverage report location are in `${submodule}/target/site/cobertura/index.html`

## Getting the source code
First of all, you need the Zeppelin source code.

The official location for Zeppelin is [http://git.apache.org/zeppelin.git](http://git.apache.org/zeppelin.git).

### git access

Get the source code on your development machine using git.

```
git clone git://git.apache.org/zeppelin.git zeppelin
```

You may also want to develop against a specific branch. For example, for branch-0.5.6

```
git clone -b branch-0.5.6 git://git.apache.org/zeppelin.git zeppelin
```

or with write access

```
git clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/zeppelin.git
```

### Fork repository

If you want not only build Zeppelin but also make change, then you need fork [Zeppelin github mirror repository](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin) and make a pull request.


## Build

### Build Tools

To build the code, install

 * Oracle Java 7
 * Apache Maven

### Building the code

```
mvn install
```

To skip test

```
mvn install -DskipTests
```

To build with specific spark / hadoop version

```
mvn install -Phadoop-2.2 -Dhadoop.version=2.2.0 -Pspark-1.3 -Dspark.version=1.3.0
```

## Tests
Each new File should have its own accompanying unit tests. Each new interpreter should have come with its tests.


Zeppelin has 3 types of tests:

* __Unit Tests:__ The unit tests run as part of each package's build. E.g. SparkInterpeter Module's unit test is SparkInterpreterTest
* __Integration Tests:__ The integration tests run after all modules are build. The integration tests launch an instance of Zeppelin server. ZeppelinRestApiTest is an example integration test.
* __GUI integration tests:__ These tests validate the Zeppelin UI elements. These tests require a running Zeppelin server and launches a web browser to validate Notebook UI elements like Notes and their execution. See ZeppelinIT as an example.

Currently the __GUI integration tests__ are not run in the Maven and are only run in the CI environment when the pull request is submitted to github.

Make sure to watch the [CI results] (https://travis-ci.org/apache/zeppelin/pull_requests) for your pull request.

#### Running GUI integration tests locally

##### All tests, just like the CI:

```
PATH=~/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/:$PATH CI="true" mvn verify -Pspark-1.6 -Phadoop-2.3 -Ppyspark -B -pl "zeppelin-interpreter,zeppelin-zengine,zeppelin-server,zeppelin-display,spark-dependencies,spark" -Dtest="org.apache.zeppelin.AbstractFunctionalSuite" -DfailIfNoTests=false
```

##### Next to a Running instance of Zeppelin

This allows you to target a specific __GUI integration test__.

```
TEST_SELENIUM="true" mvn package -DfailIfNoTests=false -pl 'zeppelin-interpreter,zeppelin-zengine,zeppelin-server' -Dtest=ParagraphActionsIT
```

## Continuous Integration

Zeppelin uses Travis for CI. In the project root there is .travis.yml that configures CI and [publishes CI results] (https://travis-ci.org/apache/zeppelin/builds)


## Run Zeppelin server in development mode

```
cd zeppelin-server
HADOOP_HOME=YOUR_HADOOP_HOME JAVA_HOME=YOUR_JAVA_HOME mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.apache.zeppelin.server.ZeppelinServer" -Dexec.args=""
```

or use daemon script

```
bin/zeppelin-daemon start
```

Server will be run on http://localhost:8080
