# How to Write a Controller

<br/>
Our main rule regarding writing a controller, is to use the `Controller as vm` style, however, we also have a few other style guidelines.

You can see below a full example of what the controller would look like.

```
(function() {
  'use strict';

  angular.module('zeppelinWebApp')
    .controller('myNewController', myNewController);

    myNewController.$inject = ['$http'];

    function myNewController($http) {

      var vm = this;

      vm.publicVariable = {};

      // Controller's public functions
      vm.myControllerPublicFunction = myControllerPublicFunction;

      _init();

      /*************************************
      ** Public functions Implementation **
      *************************************/

      function myControllerPublicFunction() {

        ...

      }

      function myOtherPublicFunction() {

        _utilFunction();
        ...

      }

      /*************************************
      ** Private functions Implementation **
      *************************************/

      function _init() {

        vm.myControllerPublicFunction();
        ...

      }

      function _utilFunction() {

        ...

      }

      /***************************************
      ** $scope.$on catchers Implementation **
      ***************************************/

      $scope.$on('eventName', function(event) {

        ...

      })
    }
})();
```

This might look like a lot of lines, but it is mainly to show all the rules at once.


#### Using the controller in a view

Now let's see how we can use it inside our `.html` view in normal situations.

```
<div ng-controller="myNewController as newCtrl">
  <div ng-click="newCtrl.myControllerPublicFunction">{{ newCtrl.publicVariable }}</div>
</div>
```

#### Using the controller in a page

In the case where your controller will be used on a view directly linked to a route

For example: `localhost:8080/myPageName`

The definition of the controller will take place in the `$routeProvider` section of the `app.js` file.

```
.when('/myPageName', {
  templateUrl: 'app/myPageName/myPageName.html',
  controller: 'myNewController',
  controllerAs: 'newCtrl'
})
```

Which will leave the `.html` view without any `ng-controller` property.

```
<div>
  <div ng-click="newCtrl.myControllerPublicFunction">{{ newCtrl.publicVariable }}</div>
</div>
```

#### The rules in detail

* Except `$scope.$on` and a few special cases, we do not use the `$scope` of that controller
* Only the functions and variables needed in the view should be linked to the `vm`
* The view is using the controller's variables and functions through the 'as' keyword you set
* Private functions' name start with a `_`
* Functions and variables are grouped by type in that order:
private variables, public variables, init function call, public functions, private functions, $scope.$on functions
* There is a nice comment separating all those groups
* Services are added to the controller using the `$inject` at the top of the component
* Inside the controller, you call the public functions using `vm.nameOfTheFunction()`
