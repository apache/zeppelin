# Install 

<div id="toc"></div>

Welcome to Apache Zeppelin! On this page are instructions to help you get started.

## Requirements 

Apache Zeppelin officially supports and is tested on the following environments:

<table class="table-configuration">
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Value</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Oracle JDK</td>
    <td>1.8 (171) <br /> (set <code>JAVA_HOME</code>)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>OS</td>
    <td>Mac OSX <br /> Ubuntu 14.X <br /> CentOS 6.X <br /> Windows 7 Pro SP1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Downloading Binary Package

Two binary packages are available on the [download page](http://zeppelin.apache.org/download.html). Only difference between these two binaries is interpreters are included in the package file.

- **all interpreter package**: unpack it in a directory of your choice and you're ready to go.
- **net-install interpreter package**: unpack and follow [install additional interpreters](../usage/interpreter/installation.html) to install interpreters. If you're unsure, just run `./bin/install-interpreter.sh --all` and install all interpreters.
  
### Building Zeppelin from source

follow the instructions [How to Build](../setup/basics/how_to_build.html), If you want to build from source instead of using binary package.

## Starting Apache Zeppelin

#### Starting Apache Zeppelin from the Command Line

On all unix like platforms:

```
bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh start
```

If you are on Windows:

```
bin\zeppelin.cmd
```

After Zeppelin has started successfully, go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with your web browser.

#### Stopping Zeppelin

```
bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh stop
```

## Start Apache Zeppelin with a service manager

> **Note :** The below description was written based on Ubuntu.

Apache Zeppelin can be auto-started as a service with an init script, using a service manager like **upstart**.

This is an example upstart script saved as `/etc/init/zeppelin.conf`
This allows the service to be managed with commands such as

```
sudo service zeppelin start  
sudo service zeppelin stop  
sudo service zeppelin restart
```

Other service managers could use a similar approach with the `upstart` argument passed to the `zeppelin-daemon.sh` script.

```
bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh upstart
```

**zeppelin.conf**

```
description "zeppelin"

start on (local-filesystems and net-device-up IFACE!=lo)
stop on shutdown

# Respawn the process on unexpected termination
respawn

# respawn the job up to 7 times within a 5 second period.
# If the job exceeds these values, it will be stopped and marked as failed.
respawn limit 7 5

# zeppelin was installed in /usr/share/zeppelin in this example
chdir /usr/share/zeppelin
exec bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh upstart
```
