# How can you publish your paragraph ?

<div id="toc"></div>

Apache Zeppelin provides a feature for publishing your notebook paragraph results. Using this feature, you can show Zeppelin notebook paragraph results in your own website. 
It's very straightforward. Just use `<iframe>` tag in your page.

## Copy a Paragraph Link
A first step to publish your paragraph result is **Copy a Paragraph Link**.

  * After running a paragraph in your Zeppelin notebook, click a gear button located on the right side. Then, click **Link this Paragraph** menu like below image.

  * Just copy the provided link. 
<center><img src="../assets/themes/zeppelin/img/docs-img/copy-the-link.png" height="100%" width="100%"></center>

## Embed the Paragraph to Your Website
For publishing the copied paragraph, you may use `<iframe>` tag in your website page.
For example,

```
<iframe src="http://< ip-address >:< port >/#/notebook/2B3QSZTKR/paragraph/...?asIframe" height="" width="" ></iframe>
```

Finally, you can show off your beautiful visualization results in your website. 
<center><img src="../assets/themes/zeppelin/img/docs-img/your-website.png" height="90%" width="90%"></center>

> **Note**: To embed the paragraph in a website, Apache Zeppelin needs to be reachable by that website. And please use this feature with caution and in a trusted environment only, as Zeppelin entire Webapp could be accessible by whoever visits your website.
