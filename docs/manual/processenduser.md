## Run zeppelin interpreter process as web front end user

 * Enable shiro auth in shiro.ini

```
[users]
user1 = password1, role1
user2 = password2, role2
```

 * Enable password-less ssh for the user you want to impersonate (say user1).

```
adduser user1
#ssh-keygen (optional if you don't already have generated ssh-key.
ssh user1@localhost mkdir -p .ssh
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user1@localhost 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'
```

 * Start zeppelin server.

 * Go to interpreter setting page, and enable "User Impersonate" in any of the interpreter (in my example its shell interpreter)
 
 * Test with a simple paragraph

```
%sh
whoami
