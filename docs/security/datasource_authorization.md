# Data Source Authorization in Apache Zeppelin

<div id="toc"></div>

## Overview

Data source authorization involves authenticating to the data source like a Mysql database and letting it determine user permissions.
Apache Zeppelin allows users to use their own credentials to authenticate with **Data Sources**.

For example, let's assume you have an account in the Vertica databases with credentials. 
You might want to use this account to create a JDBC connection instead of a shared account with all users who are defined in `conf/shiro.ini`. 
In this case, you can add your credential information to Apache Zeppelin and use them with below simple steps.  

## How to save the credential information?
You can add new credentials in the dropdown menu for your data source which can be passed to interpreters.

**Entity** can be the key that distinguishes each credential sets. Type **Username & Password** for your own credentials. ex) user & password of Mysql

The credentials saved as per users defined in `conf/shiro.ini`.
If you didn't activate [shiro authentication in Apache Zeppelin](./shiroauthentication.html), your credential information will be saved as `anonymous`.
All credential information also can be found in `conf/credentials.json`. 

#### JDBC interpreter
You need to maintain per-user connection pools.
The interpret method takes the user string as a parameter and executes the jdbc call using a connection in the user's connection pool.

#### Presto 
You don't need a password if the Presto DB server runs backend code using HDFS authorization for the user.

#### Vertica and Mysql 
You have to store the password information for users.

## Please note
As a first step of data source authentication feature, [ZEPPELIN-828](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-828) was proposed and implemented in Pull Request [#860](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/860).
Currently, only customized 3rd party interpreters can use this feature. We are planning to apply this mechanism to [the community interpreters](../manual/interpreterinstallation.md#available-community-managed-interpreters) in the near future. 
Please keep track [ZEPPELIN-1070](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1070).
