# Security Overview

There are three aspects to Zeppelin security:

* Authentication: is the user who they say they are? [More](authentication.html)
* Notebook authorization: does the user have permissions to read or write to a note? [More](notebook_authorization.html)
* Interpreter and data source authorization: does the user have permissions to perform interpreter operations or access data source objects? [More](interpreter_authorization.html)
