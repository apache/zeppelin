# Shiro authentication for Apache Zeppelin

<div id="toc"></div>

## Overview
[Apache Shiro](http://shiro.apache.org/) is a powerful and easy-to-use Java security framework that performs authentication, authorization, cryptography, and session management. In this documentation, we will explain step by step how Shiro works for Zeppelin notebook authentication.

When you connect to Apache Zeppelin, you will be asked to enter your credentials. Once you logged in, then you have access to all notes including other user's notes.

## Security Setup
You can setup **Zeppelin notebook authentication** in some simple steps.

### 1. Secure the HTTP channel
To secure the HTTP channel, you have to change both **anon** and **authc** settings in `conf/shiro.ini`. In here, **anon** means "the access is anonymous" and **authc** means "formed auth security".

The default status of them is

```
/** = anon
#/** = authc
```
Deactivate the line "/** = anon" and activate the line "/** = authc" in `conf/shiro.ini` file.

```
#/** = anon
/** = authc
```

For the further information about  `shiro.ini` file format, please refer to [Shiro Configuration](http://shiro.apache.org/configuration.html#Configuration-INISections).

### 2. Secure the Websocket channel
Set to property **zeppelin.anonymous.allowed** to **false** in `conf/zeppelin-site.xml`. If you don't have this file yet, just copy `conf/zeppelin-site.xml.template` to `conf/zeppelin-site.xml`.

### 3. Start Zeppelin

```
bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh start (or restart)
```

Then you can browse Zeppelin at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

### 4. Login
Finally, you can login using one of the below **username/password** combinations.

```
admin = password1
user1 = password2
user2 = password3
```

### 5. Groups and permissions (optional)
In case you want to leverage user groups and permissions, use one of the following configuration for LDAP or AD under `[main]` segment in `shiro.ini`

```
activeDirectoryRealm = org.apache.zeppelin.server.ActiveDirectoryGroupRealm
activeDirectoryRealm.systemUsername = userNameA
activeDirectoryRealm.systemPassword = passwordA
activeDirectoryRealm.searchBase = CN=Users,DC=SOME_GROUP,DC=COMPANY,DC=COM
activeDirectoryRealm.url = ldap://ldap.test.com:389
activeDirectoryRealm.groupRolesMap = "CN=aGroupName,OU=groups,DC=SOME_GROUP,DC=COMPANY,DC=COM":"group1"
activeDirectoryRealm.authorizationCachingEnabled = false

ldapRealm = org.apache.zeppelin.server.LdapGroupRealm
# search base for ldap groups (only relevant for LdapGroupRealm):
ldapRealm.contextFactory.environment[ldap.searchBase] = dc=COMPANY,dc=COM
ldapRealm.contextFactory.url = ldap://ldap.test.com:389
ldapRealm.userDnTemplate = uid={0},ou=Users,dc=COMPANY,dc=COM
ldapRealm.contextFactory.authenticationMechanism = SIMPLE
```
 
also define roles/groups that you want to have in system, like below;

```
[roles]
admin = *
hr = *
finance = *
group1 = *
```

All of above configurations are defined in the `conf/shiro.ini` file.
