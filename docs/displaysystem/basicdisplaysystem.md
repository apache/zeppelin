# Basic Display System in Apache Zeppelin

<div id="toc"></div>

## Text

By default, Apache Zeppelin prints interpreter responce as a plain text using `text` display system.

You can explicitly say you're using `text` display system.

## Html

With `%html` directive, Zeppelin treats your output as HTML

<img src="/assets/themes/zeppelin/img/screenshots/display_html.png" />

## Table

If you have data that row seprated by '\n' (newline) and column separated by '\t' (tab) with first row as header row, for example

<img src="/assets/themes/zeppelin/img/screenshots/display_table.png" />

You can simply use `%table` display system to leverage Zeppelin's built in visualization.

<img src="/assets/themes/zeppelin/img/screenshots/display_table1.png" />

If table contents start with `%html`, it is interpreted as an HTML.

> **Note :** Display system is backend independent.
