# Manual upgrade procedure for Zeppelin

<div id="toc"></div>

Basically, newer version of Zeppelin works with previous version notebook directory and configurations.
So, copying `notebook` and `conf` directory should be enough.

## Instructions
1. Stop Zeppelin: `bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh stop`
2. Copy your `notebook` and `conf` directory into a backup directory
3. Download newer version of Zeppelin and Install. See [Install Guide](../../quickstart/install.html#install).
4. Copy backup `notebook` and `conf` directory into newer version of Zeppelin `notebook` and `conf` directory
5. Start Zeppelin:  `bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh start`

## Migration Guide

### Breaking changes in 0.8.x

From 0.8, Zeppelin has a new type of permission - [Runners](http://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.8.0/setup/security/notebook_authorization.html#authorization-setting)

As Runners list is empty in note so everybody can view note although Readers list is not empty. 
To set all your "writers" to "runners":
1. Copy `notebook` and `conf` directories to 0.8.0,
2. Move directory **docs/assets/themes/zeppelin/note/FixReaders** to new `notebook` directory,
3. Start the new Zeppelin and run note **System/Migrate from 0.7**.


### Upgrading from Zeppelin 0.7 to 0.8

 - From 0.8, we recommend to use `PYSPARK_PYTHON` and `PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON` instead of `zeppelin.pyspark.python` as `zeppelin.pyspark.python` only effects driver. You can use `PYSPARK_PYTHON` and `PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON` as using them in spark.
 - From 0.8, depending on your device, the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl-L` or `Command-L` which goes to the line somewhere user wants is not supported. 
 
### Upgrading from Zeppelin 0.6 to 0.7

 - From 0.7, we don't use `ZEPPELIN_JAVA_OPTS` as default value of `ZEPPELIN_INTP_JAVA_OPTS` and also the same for `ZEPPELIN_MEM`/`ZEPPELIN_INTP_MEM`. If user want to configure the jvm opts of interpreter process, please set `ZEPPELIN_INTP_JAVA_OPTS` and `ZEPPELIN_INTP_MEM` explicitly. If you don't set `ZEPPELIN_INTP_MEM`, Zeppelin will set it to `-Xms1024m -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m` by default.
 - Mapping from `%jdbc(prefix)` to `%prefix` is no longer available. Instead, you can use %[interpreter alias] with multiple interpreter setttings on GUI.
 - Usage of `ZEPPELIN_PORT` is not supported in ssl mode. Instead use `ZEPPELIN_SSL_PORT` to configure the ssl port. Value from `ZEPPELIN_PORT` is used only when `ZEPPELIN_SSL` is set to `false`.
 - The support on Spark 1.1.x to 1.3.x is deprecated.
 - From 0.7, we uses `pegdown` as the `markdown.parser.type` option for the `%md` interpreter. Rendered markdown might be different from what you expected
 - From 0.7 note.json format has been changed to support multiple outputs in a paragraph. Zeppelin will automatically convert old format to new format. 0.6 or lower version can read new note.json format but output will not be displayed. For the detail, see [ZEPPELIN-212](http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-212) and [pull request](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1658).
 - From 0.7 note storage layer will utilize `GitNotebookRepo` by default instead of `VFSNotebookRepo` storage layer, which is an extension of latter one with versioning capabilities on top of it.
