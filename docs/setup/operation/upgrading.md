# Manual upgrade procedure for Zeppelin

<div id="toc"></div>

Basically, newer version of Zeppelin works with previous version notebook directory and configurations.
So, copying `notebook` and `conf` directory should be enough.

## Instructions
1. Stop Zeppelin: `bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh stop`
2. Copy your `notebook` and `conf` directory into a backup directory
3. Download newer version of Zeppelin and Install. See [Install Guide](../../quickstart/install.html#install).
4. Copy backup `notebook` and `conf` directory into newer version of Zeppelin `notebook` and `conf` directory
5. Start Zeppelin:  `bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh start`

## Migration Guide

### Upgrading from Zeppelin 0.8 to 0.9

 - From 0.9, we change the notes file name structure ([ZEPPELIN-2619](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2619)) and move permissions info from `notebook-authorization.json` into note file itself [ZEPPELIN-3985](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3985). So when you upgrading zeppelin to 0.9, you need to upgrade note file. Here's steps you need to follow:
   1. Backup your notes file in case the upgrade fails
   2. Call `bin/upgrade-note.sh -d` to upgrade note, `-d` option means to delete the old note file, missing this option will keep the old file.
 - From 0.9, Zeppelin server bind `127.0.0.1` by default instead of `0.0.0.0`. Configure `zeppelin.server.addr` property or `ZEPPELIN_ADDR` env variable to change.
 - From 0.9, we have removed `zeppelin.anonymous.allowed` ([ZEPPELIN-4489](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-4489)). So, when you upgrade Zeppelin to 0.9 and if `shiro.ini` file does not exists in conf path then all the Zeppelin-Users runs as anonymous.

### Upgrading from Zeppelin 0.8.1 (and before) to 0.8.2 (and later)
 - From 0.8.2, Zeppelin server bind `127.0.0.1` by default instead of `0.0.0.0`. Configure `zeppelin.server.addr` property or `ZEPPELIN_ADDR` env variable to change.

### Upgrading from Zeppelin 0.7 to 0.8

 - From 0.8, we recommend to use `PYSPARK_PYTHON` and `PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON` instead of `zeppelin.pyspark.python` as `zeppelin.pyspark.python` only effects driver. You can use `PYSPARK_PYTHON` and `PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON` as using them in spark.
 - From 0.8, depending on your device, the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl-L` or `Command-L` which goes to the line somewhere user wants is not supported. 

### Upgrading from Zeppelin 0.6 to 0.7

 - From 0.7, we don't use `ZEPPELIN_JAVA_OPTS` as default value of `ZEPPELIN_INTP_JAVA_OPTS` and also the same for `ZEPPELIN_MEM`/`ZEPPELIN_INTP_MEM`. If user want to configure the jvm opts of interpreter process, please set `ZEPPELIN_INTP_JAVA_OPTS` and `ZEPPELIN_INTP_MEM` explicitly. If you don't set `ZEPPELIN_INTP_MEM`, Zeppelin will set it to `-Xms1024m -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m` by default.
 - Mapping from `%jdbc(prefix)` to `%prefix` is no longer available. Instead, you can use %[interpreter alias] with multiple interpreter setttings on GUI.
 - Usage of `ZEPPELIN_PORT` is not supported in ssl mode. Instead use `ZEPPELIN_SSL_PORT` to configure the ssl port. Value from `ZEPPELIN_PORT` is used only when `ZEPPELIN_SSL` is set to `false`.
 - The support on Spark 1.1.x to 1.3.x is deprecated.
 - From 0.7, we uses `pegdown` as the `markdown.parser.type` option for the `%md` interpreter. Rendered markdown might be different from what you expected
 - From 0.7 note.json format has been changed to support multiple outputs in a paragraph. Zeppelin will automatically convert old format to new format. 0.6 or lower version can read new note.json format but output will not be displayed. For the detail, see [ZEPPELIN-212](http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-212) and [pull request](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1658).
 - From 0.7 note storage layer will utilize `GitNotebookRepo` by default instead of `VFSNotebookRepo` storage layer, which is an extension of latter one with versioning capabilities on top of it.
