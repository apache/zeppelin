# Contributing to Apache Zeppelin ( Website )

<div id="toc"></div>


This page will give you an overview of how to build and contribute to the documentation of Apache Zeppelin.
The online documentation at [zeppelin.apache.org](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/latest/) is also generated from the files found here.

> **NOTE :** Apache Zeppelin is an [Apache2 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html) Software.
Any contributions to Zeppelin (Source code, Documents, Image, Website) means you agree with license all your contributions as Apache2 License.

## Getting the source code
First of all, you need Zeppelin source code. The official location of Zeppelin is [http://git.apache.org/zeppelin.git](http://git.apache.org/zeppelin.git).
Documentation website is hosted in 'master' branch under `/docs/` dir.

### git access

First of all, you need the website source code. The official location of mirror for Zeppelin is [http://git.apache.org/zeppelin.git](http://git.apache.org/zeppelin.git).
Get the source code on your development machine using git.

```bash
git clone git://git.apache.org/zeppelin.git
cd docs
```
Apache Zeppelin follows [Fork & Pull](https://github.com/sevntu-checkstyle/sevntu.checkstyle/wiki/Development-workflow-with-Git:-Fork,-Branching,-Commits,-and-Pull-Request) as a source control workflow.
If you want to not only build Zeppelin but also make any changes, then you need to fork [Zeppelin github mirror repository](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin) and make a pull request.

### Build

You'll need to install some prerequisites to build the code. Please check [Build documentation](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/docs/README.md#build-documentation) section in [docs/README.md](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/docs/README.md).

### Run website in development mode

While you're modifying website, you might want to see preview of it. Please check [Run website](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/docs/README.md#run-website) section in [docs/README.md](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/docs/README.md).
Then you'll be able to access it on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) with your web browser.

### Making a Pull Request

When you are ready, just make a pull-request.


## Alternative way

You can directly edit `.md` files in `/docs/` directory at the web interface of github and make pull-request immediately.

## Stay involved
Contributors should join the Zeppelin mailing lists.
