# Contributing to Apache Zeppelin ( Code )

<div id="toc"></div>

> **NOTE :** Apache Zeppelin is an [Apache2 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html) Software.
Any contributions to Zeppelin (Source code, Documents, Image, Website) means you agree with license all your contributions as Apache2 License.

## Setting up
Here are some tools you will need to build and test Zeppelin.

#### Software Configuration Management ( SCM )

Since Zeppelin uses Git for it's SCM system, you need git client installed in your development machine.

#### Integrated Development Environment ( IDE )

You are free to use whatever IDE you prefer, or your favorite command line editor.

#### Code Style

We decided to use `google-java-format`. You can install this formatter from [https://github.com/google/google-java-format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format). And the build script also contains `fmt-maven-plugin` to verify the formats of files. You can check `mvn validate` and fix wrong formats by running `mvn fmt:format` manually.

#### Build Tools

To build the code, install

  * Oracle Java 8
  * Apache Maven

## Getting the source code
First of all, you need Zeppelin source code. The official location of Zeppelin is [http://git.apache.org/zeppelin.git](http://git.apache.org/zeppelin.git).

### git access

Get the source code on your development machine using git.

```bash
git clone git://git.apache.org/zeppelin.git zeppelin
```

You may also want to develop against a specific branch. For example, for branch-0.5.6

```bash
git clone -b branch-0.5.6 git://git.apache.org/zeppelin.git zeppelin
```

Apache Zeppelin follows [Fork & Pull](https://github.com/sevntu-checkstyle/sevntu.checkstyle/wiki/Development-workflow-with-Git:-Fork,-Branching,-Commits,-and-Pull-Request) as a source control workflow.
If you want to not only build Zeppelin but also make any changes, then you need to fork [Zeppelin github mirror repository](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin) and make a pull request.

Before making a pull request, please take a look [Contribution Guidelines](http://zeppelin.apache.org/contribution/contributions.html).


### Build

```bash
mvn install
```

To skip test

```bash
mvn install -DskipTests
```

To build with specific spark / hadoop version

```bash
mvn install -Dspark.version=x.x.x -Dhadoop.version=x.x.x
```

For the further 

### Run Zeppelin server in development mode

#### Option 1 - Command Line

1. Copy the `conf/zeppelin-site.xml.template` to `zeppelin-server/src/main/resources/zeppelin-site.xml` and change the configurations in this file if required
2. Run the following command

```bash
cd zeppelin-server
HADOOP_HOME=YOUR_HADOOP_HOME JAVA_HOME=YOUR_JAVA_HOME \
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.apache.zeppelin.server.ZeppelinServer" -Dexec.args=""
```

#### Option 2 - Daemon Script

> **Note:** Make sure you first run 

```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

in your zeppelin root directory, otherwise your server build will fail to find the required dependencies in the local repro.

or use daemon script

```bash
bin/zeppelin-daemon start
```

Server will be run on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

#### Option 3 - IDE

1. Copy the `conf/zeppelin-site.xml.template` to `zeppelin-server/src/main/resources/zeppelin-site.xml` and change the configurations in this file if required
2. `ZeppelinServer.java` Main class


### Generating Thrift Code

Some portions of the Zeppelin code are generated by [Thrift](http://thrift.apache.org). For most Zeppelin changes, you don't need to worry about this. But if you modify any of the Thrift IDL files (e.g. zeppelin-interpreter/src/main/thrift/*.thrift), then you also need to regenerate these files and submit their updated version as part of your patch.

To regenerate the code, install **thrift-0.9.2** and then run the following command to generate thrift code.

```bash
cd <zeppelin_home>/zeppelin-interpreter/src/main/thrift
./genthrift.sh
```

### Run Selenium test

Zeppelin has [set of integration tests](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/tree/master/zeppelin-server/src/test/java/org/apache/zeppelin/integration) using Selenium. To run these test, first build and run Zeppelin and make sure Zeppelin is running on port 8080. Then you can run test using following command

```bash
TEST_SELENIUM=true mvn test -Dtest=[TEST_NAME] -DfailIfNoTests=false \
-pl 'zeppelin-interpreter,zeppelin-zengine,zeppelin-server'
```

For example, to run [ParagraphActionIT](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-server/src/test/java/org/apache/zeppelin/integration/ParagraphActionsIT.java),

```bash
TEST_SELENIUM=true mvn test -Dtest=ParagraphActionsIT -DfailIfNoTests=false \
-pl 'zeppelin-interpreter,zeppelin-zengine,zeppelin-server'
```

You'll need Firefox web browser installed in your development environment. While CI server uses [Firefox 31.0](https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/31.0/) to run selenium test, it is good idea to install the same version (disable auto update to keep the version).
