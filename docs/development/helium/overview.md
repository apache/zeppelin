# Helium Overview

<div id="toc"></div>

## What is Helium? 

Helium is a plugin system that can extend Zeppelin a lot. 
For example, you can write [custom display system](./writing_spell.html) or 
install already published one in [Helium Online Registry](http://zeppelin.apache.org/helium_packages.html). 

Currently, Helium supports 4 types of package.

- [Helium Visualization](./writing_visualization_basic.html): Adding a new chart type
- [Helium Spell](./writing_spell.html): Adding new interpreter, display system running on browser
- [Helium Application](./writing_application.html) 
- [Helium Interpreter](../writing_zeppelin_interpreter.html): Adding a new custom interpreter
