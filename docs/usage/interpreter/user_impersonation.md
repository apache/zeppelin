# Impersonation

User impersonation enables to run zeppelin interpreter process as a web frontend user

## Setup

#### 1. Enable Shiro auth in `conf/shiro.ini`

```
[users]
user1 = password1, role1
user2 = password2, role2
```

#### 2. Enable password-less ssh for the user you want to impersonate (say user1).

```bash
adduser user1
#ssh-keygen (optional if you don't already have generated ssh-key.
ssh user1@localhost mkdir -p .ssh
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user1@localhost 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'
```

Alternatively instead of password-less, user can override ZEPPELIN_IMPERSONATE_CMD in zeppelin-env.sh

```bash
export ZEPPELIN_IMPERSONATE_CMD='sudo -H -u ${ZEPPELIN_IMPERSONATE_USER} bash -c '
```


#### 4. Restart zeppelin server.

```bash
# for OSX, linux
bin/zeppelin-daemon restart

# for windows
bin\zeppelin.cmd
```

#### 5. Configure impersonation for interpreter 

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-12" >
      <a data-lightbox="compiler" href="{{BASE_PATH}}/assets/themes/zeppelin/img/screenshots/user-impersonation.gif">
        <img class="img-responsive" src="{{BASE_PATH}}/assets/themes/zeppelin/img/screenshots/user-impersonation.gif" />
      </a>

  </div>
</div>

<br/>

Go to interpreter setting page, and enable "User Impersonate" in any of the interpreter (in my example its shell interpreter)

#### 6. Test with a simple paragraph

```bash
%sh
whoami
```

Note that usage of "User Impersonate" option will enable Spark interpreter to use `--proxy-user` option with current user by default. If you want to disable `--proxy-user` option, then refer to `ZEPPELIN_IMPERSONATE_SPARK_PROXY_USER` variable in `conf/zeppelin-env.sh`
