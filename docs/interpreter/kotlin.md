# Kotlin interpreter for Apache Zeppelin

<div id="toc"></div>

## Overview
Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference.
It is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of its standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise.

## Configuration
<table class="table-configuration">
  <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Default</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>zeppelin.kotlin.maxResult</td>
        <td>1000</td>
        <td>Max n</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>zeppelin.kotlin.shortenTypes</td>
        <td>true</td>
        <td>Display shortened types instead of full, e.g. Int vs kotlin.Int</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Example

```kotlin
%kotlin 

fun square(n: Int): Int = n * n
```

## Kotlin Context
Kotlin context is accessible via `kc` object bound to the interpreter. 
It holds `vars` and `functions` fields that return all user-defined variables and functions present in the interpreter.
You can also print variables or functions by calling `kc.showVars()` or `kc.showFunctions()`.

### Example


```kotlin
fun square(n: Int): Int = n * n

val greeter = { s: String -> println("Hello $s!") }
val l = listOf("Drive", "to", "develop")

kc.showVars()
kc.showFunctions()
```
Output:
```
l: List<String> = [Drive, to, develop]
greeter: (String) -> Unit = (kotlin.String) -> kotlin.Unit
fun square(Int): Int
```
