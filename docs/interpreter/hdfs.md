## Overview
[Hadoop File System](http://hadoop.apache.org/) is a distributed, fault tolerant file system part of the hadoop project and is often used as storage for distributed processing engines like [Hadoop MapReduce](http://hadoop.apache.org/) and [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) or underlying file systems like [Alluxio](http://www.alluxio.org/).

<br/>
This interpreter connects to HDFS using the HTTP WebHDFS interface.
It supports the basic shell file commands applied to HDFS, it currently only supports browsing.

* You can use <i>ls [PATH]</i> and <i>ls -l [PATH]</i> to list a directory. If the path is missing, then the current directory is listed.  <i>ls </i> supports a <i>-h</i> flag for human readable file sizes.
* You can use <i>cd [PATH]</i> to change your current directory by giving a relative or an absolute path.
* You can invoke <i>pwd</i> to see your current directory.

> **Tip :** Use ( Ctrl + . ) for autocompletion.

## Create Interpreter

In a notebook, to enable the **HDFS** interpreter, click the **Gear** icon and select **HDFS**.


## WebHDFS REST API
You can confirm that you're able to access the WebHDFS API by running a curl command against the WebHDFS end point provided to the interpreter.

Here is an example:

```bash
$> curl "http://localhost:50070/webhdfs/v1/?op=LISTSTATUS"
```
