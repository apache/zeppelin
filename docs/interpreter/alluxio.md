## How to test it's working
Be sure to have configured correctly the Alluxio interpreter, then open a new paragraph and type one of the above commands.

Below a simple example to show how to interact with Alluxio interpreter.
Following steps are performed:

* using sh interpreter a new text file is created on local machine
* using Alluxio interpreter:
  * is listed the content of the afs (Alluxio File System) root
  * the file previously created is copied to afs
  * is listed again the content of the afs root to check the existence of the new copied file
  * is showed the content of the copied file (using the tail command)
  * the file previously copied to afs is copied to local machine
*  using sh interpreter it's checked the existence of the new file copied from Alluxio and its content is showed
