# R Interpreter for Apache Zeppelin

<div id="toc"></div>

## Overview

[R](https://www.r-project.org) is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.

To run R code and visualize plots in Apache Zeppelin, you will need R on your zeppelin server node (or your dev laptop).

+ For Centos: `yum install R R-devel libcurl-devel openssl-devel`
+ For Ubuntu: `apt-get install r-base`

Validate your installation with a simple R command:

```
R -e "print(1+1)"
```

To enjoy plots, install additional libraries with:

+ devtools with 

  ```bash
  R -e "install.packages('devtools', repos = 'http://cran.us.r-project.org')"
  ```
  
+ knitr with 
  
  ```bash
  R -e "install.packages('knitr', repos = 'http://cran.us.r-project.org')"
  ```
  
+ ggplot2 with

  ```bash
  R -e "install.packages('ggplot2', repos = 'http://cran.us.r-project.org')"
  ```

+ Other visualization libraries: 
  
  ```bash
  R -e "install.packages(c('devtools','mplot', 'googleVis'), repos = 'http://cran.us.r-project.org'); 
  require(devtools); install_github('ramnathv/rCharts')"
  ```

We recommend you to also install the following optional R libraries for happy data analytics:

+ glmnet
+ pROC
+ data.table
+ caret
+ sqldf
+ wordcloud

## Supported Interpreters

Zeppelin supports R language in 3 interpreters

<table class="table-configuration">
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Class</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>%r.r</td>
    <td>RInterpreter</td>
    <td>Vanilla r interpreter, with least dependencies, only R environment and knitr are required.
    It is always recommended to use the fully qualified interpreter name <code>%r.r</code>, because <code>%r</code> is ambiguous, 
    it could mean <code>%spark.r</code> when current note's default interpreter is <code>%spark</code> and <code>%r.r</code> when the default interpreter is <code>%r</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>%r.ir</td>
    <td>IRInterpreter</td>
    <td>Provide more fancy R runtime via [IRKernel](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel), almost the same experience like using R in Jupyter. It requires more things, but is the recommended interpreter for using R in Zeppelin.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>%r.shiny</td>
    <td>ShinyInterpreter</td>
    <td>Run Shiny app in Zeppelin</td>
  </tr>
</table>

If you want to use R with Spark, it is almost the same via `%spark.r`, `%spark.ir` & `%spark.shiny` . You can refer Spark interpreter docs for more details.

## Configuration

    <td>1000</td>
    <td>Max number of dataframe rows to display when using z.show</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Play R in Zeppelin docker

For beginner, we would suggest you to play R in Zeppelin docker first. In the Zeppelin docker image, we have already installed R and lots of useful R libraries including IRKernel's prerequisites, so `%r.ir` is available.

Without any extra configuration, you can run most of tutorial notes under folder `R Tutorial` directly.

```
docker run -u $(id -u) -p 8080:8080 -p:6789:6789 --rm --name zeppelin apache/zeppelin:0.10.0
```

After running the above command, you can open `http://localhost:8080` to play R in Zeppelin.
The port `6789` exposed in the above command is for R shiny app. You need to make the following 2 interpreter properties to enable shiny app accessible as iframe in Zeppelin docker container. 

* `zeppelin.R.shiny.portRange` to be `6789:6789`
* Set `ZEPPELIN_LOCAL_IP` to be `0.0.0.0`

## Interpreter binding mode

The default [interpreter binding mode](../usage/interpreter/interpreter_binding_mode.html) is `globally shared`. That means all notes share the same R interpreter. 
So we would recommend you to ues `isolated per note` which means each note has own R interpreter without affecting each other. But it may run out of your machine resource if too many R
interpreters are created. You can [run R in yarn mode](../interpreter/r.html#run-r-in-yarn-cluster) to avoid this problem. 

## How to use R Interpreter

There are two different implementations of R interpreters: `%r.r` and `%r.ir`.

* Vanilla R Interpreter(`%r.r`) behaves like an ordinary REPL and use SparkR to communicate between R process and JVM process. It requires `knitr` to be installed.
* IRKernel R Interpreter(`%r.ir`) behaves like using IRKernel in Jupyter notebook. It is based on [jupyter interpreter](jupyter.html). Besides jupyter interpreter's prerequisites, [IRkernel](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel) needs to be installed as well. 

Take a look at the tutorial note `R Tutorial/1. R Basics` for how to write R code in Zeppelin.

### R basic expressions

R basic expressions are supported in both `%r.r` and `%r.ir`.

<img class="img-responsive" src="{{BASE_PATH}}/assets/themes/zeppelin/img/docs-img/r_basic.png" width="800px"/>

### R base plotting

R base plotting is supported in both `%r.r` and `%r.ir`.

<img class="img-responsive" src="{{BASE_PATH}}/assets/themes/zeppelin/img/docs-img/r_plotting.png" width="800px"/>

### Other plotting

Besides R base plotting, you can use other visualization libraries in both `%r.r` and `%r.ir`, e.g. `ggplot` and `googleVis` 

<img class="img-responsive" src="{{BASE_PATH}}/assets/themes/zeppelin/img/docs-img/r_ggplot.png" width="800px"/>

<img class="img-responsive" src="{{BASE_PATH}}/assets/themes/zeppelin/img/docs-img/r_googlevis.png" width="800px"/>

### z.show

`z.show()` is only available in `%r.ir` to visualize R dataframe, e.g.

<img class="img-responsive" src="{{BASE_PATH}}/assets/themes/zeppelin/img/docs-img/r_zshow.png" width="800px"/>

By default, `z.show` would only display 1000 rows, you can specify the maxRows via `z.show(df, maxRows=2000)`

## Make Shiny App in Zeppelin

[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/) is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web applications (apps) straight from R.
`%r.shiny` is used for developing R shiny app in Zeppelin notebook. It only works when IRKernel Interpreter(`%r.ir`) is enabled.
For developing one Shiny App in Zeppelin, you need to write at least 3 paragraphs (server type paragraph, ui type paragraph and run type paragraph)

* Server type R shiny paragraph

```r

%r.shiny(type=server)

# Define server logic to summarize and view selected dataset ----
server <- function(input, output) {

    # Return the requested dataset ----
    datasetInput <- reactive({
        switch(input$dataset,
        "rock" = rock,
        "pressure" = pressure,
        "cars" = cars)
    })

    # Generate a summary of the dataset ----
    output$summary <- renderPrint({
        dataset <- datasetInput()
        summary(dataset)
    })

    # Show the first "n" observations ----
    output$view <- renderTable({
        head(datasetInput(), n = input$obs)
    })
}
```

* UI type R shiny paragraph

```r
%r.shiny(type=ui)

# Define UI for dataset viewer app ----
ui <- fluidPage(

    # App title ----
    titlePanel("Shiny Text"),
    
    # Sidebar layout with a input and output definitions ----
    sidebarLayout(

        # Sidebar panel for inputs ----
        sidebarPanel(
        
        # Input: Selector for choosing dataset ----
        selectInput(inputId = "dataset",
        label = "Choose a dataset:",
        choices = c("rock", "pressure", "cars")),
        
        # Input: Numeric entry for number of obs to view ----
        numericInput(inputId = "obs",
        label = "Number of observations to view:",
        value = 10)
        ),

        # Main panel for displaying outputs ----
        mainPanel(
        
        # Output: Verbatim text for data summary ----
        verbatimTextOutput("summary"),
        
        # Output: HTML table with requested number of observations ----
        tableOutput("view")
        
        )
    )
)
```

* Run type R shiny paragraph

```r

%r.shiny(type=run)

```

After executing the run type R shiny paragraph, the shiny app will be launched and embedded as iframe in paragraph.
Take a look at the tutorial note `R Tutorial/2. Shiny App` for how to develop R shiny app.

<img class="img-responsive" src="{{BASE_PATH}}/assets/themes/zeppelin/img/docs-img/r_shiny.png" width="800px"/>

### Run multiple shiny apps

If you want to run multiple shiny apps, you can specify `app` in paragraph local property to differentiate different shiny apps.

e.g.

```r
%r.shiny(type=ui, app=app_1)
```

```r
%r.shiny(type=server, app=app_1)
```

```r
%r.shiny(type=run, app=app_1)
```

## Run R in yarn cluster

Zeppelin support to [run interpreter in yarn cluster](../quickstart/yarn.html). But there's one critical problem to run R in yarn cluster: how to manage the R environment in yarn container. 
Because yarn cluster is a distributed cluster which is composed of many nodes, and your R interpreter can start in any node. 
It is not practical to manage R environment in each node.

So in order to run R in yarn cluster, we would suggest you to use conda to manage your R environment, and Zeppelin can ship your
R conda environment to yarn container, so that each R interpreter can have its own R environment without affecting each other.

To be noticed, you can only run IRKernel interpreter(`%r.ir`) in yarn cluster. So make sure you include at least the following prerequisites in the below conda env:

* python
* jupyter
* grpcio
* protobuf
* r-base
* r-essentials
* r-irkernel

`python`, `jupyter`, `grpcio` and `protobuf` are required for [jupyter interpreter](../interpreter/jupyter.html), because IRKernel interpreter is based on [jupyter interpreter](../interpreter/jupyter.html). Others are for R runtime.

Following are instructions of how to run R in yarn cluster. You can find all the code in the tutorial note `R Tutorial/3. R Conda Env in Yarn Mode`.


### Step 1

We would suggest you to use conda pack to create archive of conda environment.

Here's one example of yaml file which is used to generate a conda environment with R and some useful R libraries.

* Create a yaml file for conda environment, write the following content into file `r_env.yml`

```text
name: r_env
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - python=3.9 
  - jupyter
  - grpcio
  - protobuf
  - r-base=3
  - r-essentials
  - r-evaluate
  - r-base64enc
  - r-knitr
  - r-ggplot2
  - r-irkernel
  - r-shiny
  - r-googlevis
```

* Create conda environment via this yaml file using either `conda` or `mamba`

```bash

conda env create -f r_env.yml
```

```bash

mamba env create -f r_env.yml
```


* Pack the conda environment using `conda`

```bash

conda pack -n r_env
```

### Step 2

Specify the following properties to enable yarn mode for R interpreter via [inline configuration](../usage/interpreter/overview.html#inline-generic-configuration)

```
%r.conf

zeppelin.interpreter.launcher yarn
zeppelin.yarn.dist.archives hdfs:///tmp/r_env.tar.gz#environment
zeppelin.interpreter.conda.env.name environment
```

`zeppelin.yarn.dist.archives` is the R conda environment tar file which is created in step 1. This tar will be shipped to yarn container and untar in the working directory of yarn container.
`hdfs:///tmp/r_env.tar.gz` is the R conda archive file you created in step 2. `environment` in `hdfs:///tmp/r_env.tar.gz#environment` is the folder name after untar. 
This folder name should be the same as `zeppelin.interpreter.conda.env.name`.

### Step 3

Now you can use run R interpreter in yarn container and also use any R libraries you specify in step 1.
