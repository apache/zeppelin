# SPARQL Interpreter for Apache Zeppelin

<div id="toc"></div>

## Overview
[SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/) is an RDF query language able to retrieve and manipulate data stored in Resource Description Framework (RDF) format.
Apache Zeppelin for now only supports [Apache Jena](https://jena.apache.org/) to query SPARQL-Endpoints.

To query your endpoint configure it in the Interpreter-Settings and use the **%sparql** interpreter.
Then write your query in the paragraph.
If you want the prefixes to replace the URI's, set the replaceURIs setting.

## Configuration
<table class="table-configuration">
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Default Value</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>sparql.engine</td>
    <td>jena</td>
    <td>The sparql engine to use for the queries</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>sparql.endpoint</td>
    <td>http://dbpedia.org/sparql</td>
    <td>Complete URL of the endpoint</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>sparql.replaceURIs</td>
    <td>true</td>
    <td>Replace the URIs in the result with the prefixes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>sparql.removeDatatypes</td>
    <td>true</td>
    <td>Remove the datatypes from Literals so Zeppelin can use the values</td>
  </tr>
</table>
