## Enabling the Neo4j Interpreter
In a notebook, to enable the **Neo4j** interpreter, click the **Gear** icon and select **Neo4j**.

## Using the Neo4j Interpreter
In a paragraph, use `%neo4j` to select the Neo4j interpreter and then input the Cypher commands.
For list of Cypher commands please refer to the official [Cyper Refcard](http://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-refcard/current/)

```
%neo4j
//Sample the TrumpWorld dataset
WITH
'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1Z5Vo5pbvxKJ5XpfALZXvCzW26Cl4we3OaN73K9Ae5Ss/export?format=csv&gid=1996904412' AS url
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM url AS row
RETURN row.`Entity A`, row.`Entity A Type`, row.`Entity B`, row.`Entity B Type`, row.Connection, row.`Source(s)`
LIMIT 10
```

The Neo4j interpreter leverages the [Network display system](../usage/display_system/basic.html#network) allowing to visualize the them directly from the paragraph.


### Write your Cypher queries and navigate your graph

This query:

```
%neo4j
MATCH (vp:Person {name:"VLADIMIR PUTIN"}), (dt:Person {name:"DONALD J. TRUMP"})
MATCH path = allShortestPaths( (vp)-[*]-(dt) )
RETURN path
```
produces the following result_

### Apply Zeppelin Dynamic Forms
You can leverage [Zeppelin Dynamic Form](../usage/dynamic_form/intro.html) inside your queries. This query:

```
%neo4j
MATCH (o:Organization)-[r]-()
RETURN o.name, count(*), collect(distinct type(r)) AS types
ORDER BY count(*) DESC
LIMIT ${Show top=10}
```

produces the following result:
