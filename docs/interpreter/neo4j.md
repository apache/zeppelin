# Neo4j Interpreter for Apache Zeppelin

<div id="toc"></div>

## Overview
[Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) is a highly scalable, native graph database purpose-built to leverage not only data but also its relationships.
Neo4j's native graph storage and processing engine deliver constant, real-time performance, helping enterprises build intelligent applications to meet todayâ€™s evolving data challenges.

## Enabling the Neo4j Interpreter
In a notebook, to enable the **Neo4j** interpreter, click the **Gear** icon and select **neo4j**.

## Using the Neo4j Interpreter
In a paragraph, use `%neo4j` to select the Neo4j interpreter and then write your cypher query.

```cypher
MATCH (u:User)-[p:POSTS]->(t:Tweet) RETURN u, p, t;
```

The default visualization show the query result as a table. In the tabular result if nodes and relationships are return from the query, they will show together as rows

If the query result has almost a node the **Network** button will be enabled so you can switch to the graph visualization

Leveraging the **settings** button you can customize your graph visualization, a list of nodes will be displayed and by click on each one you can set the property which will be used as node label.

### Apply Zeppelin Dynamic Forms
You can leverage [Zeppelin Dynamic Form](../manual/dynamicform.html) inside your queries. You can use both the `text input` and `select form` parameterization features.

```cypher
match (n:User{screen_name: '${user_name}'})-[r]-(m:Tweet) return n, r, m limit 10
```
![Example of query with text input](../assets/themes/zeppelin/img/docs-img/neo4j-zeppelin-form-text-input.png)

```cypher
match (n:User{screen_name: '${user_name=santand84,santand84|individue|maurofer79}'})-[r]-(m:Tweet) return n, r, m limit 10
```
