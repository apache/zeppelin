# Apache Kylin Interpreter for Apache Zeppelin

<div id="toc"></div>

## Overview
[Apache Kylin](https://kylin.apache.org/) is an open source Distributed Analytics Engine designed to provide SQL interface and multi-dimensional analysis (OLAP) on Hadoop supporting extremely large datasets, original contributed from eBay Inc. The interpreter assumes that Apache Kylin has been installed and you can connect to Apache Kylin from the machine Apache Zeppelin is installed.  
To get start with Apache Kylin, please see [Apache Kylin Quickstart](https://kylin.apache.org/docs15/index.html).

## Using the Apache Kylin Interpreter
In a paragraph, use `%kylin(project_name)` to select the **kylin** interpreter, **project name** and then input **sql**. If no project name defined, will use the default project name from the above configuration.

```sql
%kylin(learn_project)
select count(*) from kylin_sales group by part_dt
```
