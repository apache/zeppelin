       wraps solr.StandardDirectoryFactory and caches small files in memory
       for better NRT performance.

       One can force a particular implementation via solr.MMapDirectoryFactory,
       solr.NIOFSDirectoryFactory, or solr.SimpleFSDirectoryFactory.

       The default implementation is SchemaCodecFactory, which is the official Lucene

       the postings lists and per-document values in the fieldType element
       (postingsFormat/docValuesFormat). Note that most of the alternative implementations
       are experimental, so if you choose to customize the index format, it's a good
       idea to convert back to the official format e.g. via IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader)
       before upgrading to a newer version to avoid unnecessary reindexing.
       A "compressionMode" string element can be added to <codecFactory> to choose 
       between the existing compression modes in the default codec: "BEST_SPEED" (default)
       or "BEST_COMPRESSION".

         FastLRUCache has faster gets and slower puts in single
         threaded operation and thus is generally faster than LRUCache

    <!-- Filter Cache

         Cache used by SolrIndexSearcher for filters (DocSets),
         unordered sets of *all* documents that match a query.  When a
         new searcher is opened, its caches may be prepopulated or
         "autowarmed" using data from caches in the old searcher.
         autowarmCount is the number of items to prepopulate.  For
         LRUCache, the autowarmed items will be the most recently
         accessed items.

  <!-- Request Dispatcher

       This section contains instructions for how the SolrDispatchFilter
       should behave when processing requests for this SolrCore.

       handleSelect is a legacy option that affects the behavior of requests
       such as /select?qt=XXX

       handleSelect="true" will cause the SolrDispatchFilter to process
       the request and dispatch the query to a handler specified by the 
       "qt" param, assuming "/select" isn't already registered.

       handleSelect="false" will cause the SolrDispatchFilter to
       ignore "/select" requests, resulting in a 404 unless a handler
       is explicitly registered with the name "/select"

       handleSelect="true" is not recommended for new users, but is the default
       for backwards compatibility

    <!-- Request Parsing

         what restrictions may be placed on the ContentStreams from

         and stream.url parameters for specifying remote streams.

         Multipart File Uploads that Solr will allow in a Request.
         
         formdataUploadLimitInKB - specifies the max size (in KiB) of
         form data (application/x-www-form-urlencoded) sent via
         POST. You can use POST to pass request parameters not
         fitting into the URL.
         
         addHttpRequestToContext - if set to true, it will instruct
         the requestParsers to include the original HttpServletRequest
         object in the context map of the SolrQueryRequest under the 
         key "httpRequest". It will not be used by any of the existing
         Solr components, but may be useful when developing custom 
         plugins.
         
         *** WARNING ***

       http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrRequestHandler

       Incoming queries will be dispatched to a specific handler by name

       Legacy behavior: If the request path uses "/select" but no Request
       Handler has that name, and if handleSelect="true" has been specified in
       the requestDispatcher, then the Request Handler is dispatched based on
       the qt parameter.  Handlers without a leading '/' are accessed this way
       like so: http://host/app/[core/]select?qt=name  If no qt is
       given, then the requestHandler that declares default="true" will be
       used or the one named "standard".

       not be initialized until the first request that uses it.

  <!-- Document Analysis Handler

       http://wiki.apache.org/solr/AnalysisRequestHandler

       An analysis handler that provides a breakdown of the analysis
       process of provided documents. This handler expects a (single)
       content stream with the following format:

       <docs>
         <doc>
           <field name="id">1</field>
           <field name="name">The Name</field>

         <doc>...</doc>
         <doc>...</doc>
         ...
       </docs>

    Note: Each document must contain a field which serves as the
    unique key. This key is used in the returned response to associate
    an analysis breakdown to the analyzed document.

    Like the FieldAnalysisRequestHandler, this handler also supports
    query analysis by sending either an "analysis.query" or "q"
    request parameter that holds the query text to be analyzed. It
    also supports the "analysis.showmatch" parameter which when set to
    true, all field tokens that match the query tokens will be marked
    as a "match".
