# Overview
Hazelcast Jet interpreter for Apache Zeppelin

# Architecture
Current interpreter implementation supports the static REPL. It compiles the code in memory, execute it and redirect the output to Zeppelin.

### Technical overview

 * Upon starting an interpreter, an instance of `JavaCompiler` is created. 

 * When the user runs commands with java, the `JavaParser` go through the code to get a class that contains the main method.
 
 * Then it replaces the class name with random class name to avoid overriding while compilation. It creates new out & err stream to get the data in new stream instead of the console, to redirect output to Zeppelin.
 
 * If there is any error during compilation, it can catch and redirect to Zeppelin.
 
 * `JavaInterpreterUtils` contains useful methods to print out Java collections and leverage Zeppelin's built in visualization. 
 
 * `HazelcastJetInterpreterUtils` contains useful methods to print out Hazelcast specific classes (such as DAG) and leverage Zeppelin's built in visualization.
